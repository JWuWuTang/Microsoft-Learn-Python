# Microsoft Learn Python
I am learning how to code in Python on here!

Right now, I am going through the Microsoft Learn course on Python and playing around on my own.

My Variables file goes through basic print, variables, and other options

My Hello file will ask for your name and welcome you!

My SimpleCalc program will take two numbers and add, subtract, multiply, or divide them depending on what you choose. This is still a work in progress!
